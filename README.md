The purpose of this application is to ease the selection process for jobs/tradespeople. As a customer, you will be able to browse through a detailed list of tradespeople to chose one that perfectly fits your requirements. As a tradesperson, you can view all job requests and offer quotes rather than wait for customers to contact you.
